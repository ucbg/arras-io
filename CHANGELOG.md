# Update [2022-11-24]
- Arras.io now uses WebGL and WebAssembly, two technologies which should result in a significant performance improvement.

- The smooth camera option will make the camera follow your tank instead of being fixed at it.

- Alternatively, you may choose between software rendering (which behave similar to the old client and is only recommended for older devices where WebGL isn't available), low (disables antialiasing, which is the fastest), medium (enable antialiasing for non-transparent pixels, which can cause some minor rendering artifacts), and high (enable antialiasing as much as possible, which looks better at the cost of lower performance).

- Lastly, make sure to avoid any zombies that will reanimate when others die. Happy Halloween!

# Event [2022-10-25] Pumpkin Patch

- It's time to get spooky! This year, we have not one, not two, but three Halloween themed events.

- You can create a private team by putting a # and a secret number at the end of your clan tag. The secret number will make sure you spawn on a different team, but will still be removed from your name when you spawn. For example, **<XwX#42>** will show up as **<XwX>**.

In this event the leader's position will be broadcasted to the minimaps of all players so they can share their success! Additionally, killing a player will give you *all* of their score! But don't worry, #1 will of course receive some very special treatment...

- After blasting off to space, you and your team must **carefully** traverse the frictionless environment of space. To assist with movement, all tanks have been equipped with an RCS turret, but disabling it with override is ill-advised.

# Event [2022-08-13] Growth
- In this reality, you must fight not only other players, but also your own size! As you continue to gain score, your size continue to grow! Additionally, your skill points now cap out at 69 rather than 42!

- All of the maps will now feature doors, except for **Bunker** which is the original Assault layout. To unlock the door from the inside, or to lock the door, use the green button. To break the door open forcibly from the outside, or to repair it, attack the red button.
- For the **blue**(color=#00b0e1) team to win, they must capture at least half of the dominators, if there are any, in order to unlock the sanctuary. Then, they must capture all of the sanctuaries to win.
